The very first step was to choose where to do it. I chose StarCluster http://star.mit.edu/cluster/
The easiest way to operate it was via Linux, so I made a Linux virtual machine using Oracle VM VirtualBox.
Next step was to configurate StarCluster with my Amazon account. Crucial was adding keys and ID but also setting a default cluster template
Then I could easily export files to my cluster
Whenever running a cluster which had 2 or more nodes it was possible distribute work on each node using "mpirun" command.
In my example I was able to get n results of my simulation, where n is number of nodes I had launched
